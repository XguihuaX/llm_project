flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube.,indications for surgery,the patient is a 50-year-old white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the national tennessee, and several years ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement.  however developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the abc hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on month dd, yyyy.  he underwent bronchoscopy by dr. w and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  the patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and laryngology and thoracic surgery services were consulted for further management.  exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  the patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,description of procedure,the patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  following adequate monitoring by anesthesia service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  the neck was then infiltrated with 1% xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  a collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  the skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  there appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  there was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  the trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  the tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  the trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  the patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 endo tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 endo tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  a careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  after removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  the mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  stent material was removed from this area as well.  in the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  all visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  initial attempt to place a #16 montgomery t tube showed the distal lumen of the t tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  also, this was removed and a #8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  a good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  the distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  this secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl.  the skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 prolene.  tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  the patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, airway, laryngology, shiley, alteration of voice, bronchi, bronchoscopy, cannula,

of operation: , salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal with epidural.,indications:  ,this patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy.  he was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising psa.  after that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  one year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  he had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  there were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  he wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  i took him to the operating room on january 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  we both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  i felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,findings: , at exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  the bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  the opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  a nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  he was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  a generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  moist wound towels and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  we began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  the ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  an identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,we began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  this was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  we then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  there was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  we then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,we then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch.  i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  the colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia-80 stapler.  i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  the mesentery was then sealed with a ligasure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a gia-60 stapler.  we then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a gia-80 stapler, closing the open end with a ta 60.  the angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-french robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the gia-60 stapler.  the ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-french robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,as the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 vicryl sutures.  the bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the sgia polysorb-75.  between the staple lines, vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 vicryl suture ligatures.,we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  the left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a cook 8.4-french ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  the right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  we then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  a 24-french malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  the staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture.  the pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,we then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  the cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  a portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  we left an 18-french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  the malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,we matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  the stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower quadrant.  a large jp drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the indiana pouch.,the rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  the estimated blood loss was 450 ml, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  the final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  the patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","urology, radiation cystitis, voiding dysfunction, retropubic prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy, salvage cystectomy, indiana pouch continent cutaneous

at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  at this point, dr. x used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  dr. y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  dr. x and dr. y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with dr. y being on the lateral aspect of the area and dr. x on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  the tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  the patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  ultimately, dr. y and dr. x both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where dr. y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  dr. x then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  dr. y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  dr. y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  dr. y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  dr. x then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  the stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by dr. y and dr. x closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  this opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  dr. y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  electrocautery was used on the base.  there was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  dermabond and gelfoam were placed, and then dr. y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  dr. x then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 vicryl in 3 layers.  dr. y closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 rapide respectively.  a 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by dr. y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by dr. y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a foley catheter placed in the bladder.  the foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  a second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","urology, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,"

was then taken into the operating room after which general lma anesthesia was administered.  the patient was shaved and then prepped using betadine solution.  a sterile 16-french foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  a midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  the rectus fascia was opened sharply.  the perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  bookwalter retractor was then placed.  bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  the obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  the margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and hemo clips.  the lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  the bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using metzenbaum scissors.  the puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  the superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  the deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the allis over the membranous urethral area.  the dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 vicryl suture on a ct-1 needle.  the allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using metzenbaum scissors.  the urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  the urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using metzenbaum scissors.  this was extended circumferentially until the foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  the foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  the lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  the plane between denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  no tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  the prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  the seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  the bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  the specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  it was sent for permanent section.  the bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  the sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  once the posterior sutures had been placed, the foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  a 20-french foley catheter was used.  the anterior sutures were then placed.  the foley was then inflated.  the bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  mild traction of the foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  two #19-french blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  these were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  the instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.  the fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 pds.  subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 vicryl suture.  skin was approximated by using metallic clips.  the patient tolerated the operation well.","urology, prostate cancer, foley catheter, metzenbaum scissors, prostate, adenocarcinoma, bladder, lymphadenectomy,

limited to:,1.  infection.,2.  bleeding.,3.  incontinence.,4.  impotence.,5.  injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  deep venous thrombosis.,procedure in detail: , prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by dr. a without any difficulty.  the patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  a sterile 16-french foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  a midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  the rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the bovie.  transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  a bookwalter retractor was then placed.  the area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  given this patient's low gleason score and low psa with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the metzenbaum scissors.  opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  the dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  the deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using allis also and ligated by using 0 vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  with the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the bovie.  deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using metzenbaum scissors.  the urethra could then be easily identified.  nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using metzenbaum scissors.  this exposed the blue foley catheter.  anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 monocryl suture.  six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  the foley catheter was then removed.  this allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  this effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  the prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  the floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  the prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  the prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  the dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  the prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  the bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  this was developed without any difficulty.  both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  the seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  about two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  the tip was left behind.  using the bipolar gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  this was performed on the left side and then the right side.  this completely freed the prostate.  the prostate was sent for permanent section.  the opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 vicryl sutures.  the mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  the ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  the previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  this was performed by using a french ***** needle.  a 20-french foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  a 15 ml of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  the bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  a 19-french blake drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  all instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  the rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 pds.  subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 vicryl sutures.  the skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","urology,

have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  after institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  the patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  sequential compression devices were also placed.  next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  a low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using co2 gas.  next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  the camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  the robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  at this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  these arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  the pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  a total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  at this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  the proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  we then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 monocryl sutures.  before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  this was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  this was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 monocryl sutures.  next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  next, gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  there was no obvious urine extravasation.  at this time, the procedure was terminated.  the robot was undocked.  under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  also, notably a jackson-pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,disposition: , the patient was discharged to post anesthesia care unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.","urology, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl

however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  the anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  following the dissection, the 5-french feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  the bladder neck was then repaired using vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  the rest of the mucosa was then everted.  the ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  at this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  floseal was applied to the pelvis.  the bladder was then irrigated.  it was draining pink urine.  the wound was copiously irrigated.  the fascia was then closed using a #1 looped pds.  the skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  at this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  the patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the pacu.  please note that during the case about 3600 ml of blood was noted.  this was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.","urology, bilateral lymph node dissection, retropubic prostatectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, gleason score, prostate cancer, trus, biopsy, bilateral lymph node, lymph node dissection, catheter was inserted, bilateral lymph, node dissection, vicryl stitch, prostatic pedicles, pelvic veins, external iliac, iliac vein, seminal vesicle, lymph node, foley catheter, dorsal venous, venous complex, bladder neck, dissection, prostatectomy, bladder, endopelvic, vicryl, catheter, vein, venous, fascia, dorsal, urethra, "

subsequently drained with a red robinson catheter.  at that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  at that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  this was dissected out bluntly and sharply with metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  at this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  as we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  at that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  this was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  the corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  however, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  this was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  the left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  after removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  both corporal bodies were then dilated with the pratt dilators.  these were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  at this point, using the farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  he had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  we decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  we felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  at this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the farlow device and the keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  this then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the farlow device through the glans penis.  there was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  the rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 pds in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  at that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  there was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  at that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  this was held in place with a babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  the entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  after completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  at that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  the soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  the soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  please also note that prior to the skin closure, a jackson-pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  this was also sutured in place with nylon.  sterile dressing was applied.  light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  no foley catheter was used or placed.,the patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  he will be admitted overnight to the service of dr. mcdevitt.  cardiology will be asked to consult with dr. stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the telemetry floor and kept on iv

illness:,  the patient is an 18-year-old detainee who was brought by police officers because of a penile injury and bleeding.  he is otherwise healthy.  he tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago.  he told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble.  then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there.  he was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has.  then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out.  he was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs.  so, he was brought to the hospital.  actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked

emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,operative procedure in detail: , the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position, prepped with betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  a 20- french foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  the table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  a midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  it was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  both obturator fossae were exposed.  standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  the left side was approached first by myself.  the limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to cooper's ligament distally.  meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  the right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  both packets were sent to pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,my attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  the  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  using gentle dissection with a kitner, i swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  a back bleeding control suture of 0 vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  a sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  the proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion.  when i was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,the urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  the prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  the lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  the seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  the bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  the prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  the bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  the bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  it was closed using a running 2-0 vicryl.  the mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 vicryl suture.  at the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  the field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  when i was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  a new 20-french foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  a safety suture of 0 prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  the table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the monocryl sutures were ligated.  the bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  the pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  a 10-french jackson-pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,the wound was then closed in layers.  the muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 vicryl subcuticular.  steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,the patient was taken to the recovery room in good

16-year-old african-american male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago.  the patient did have an mri, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.,procedure details:  ,the patient did receive ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure.  he was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered.  he was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region.  the fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with bovie electrocautery.  the fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with metzenbaum scissors.  this was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  with this accomplished, the testis was then identified.  it was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,the cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord.  once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens.  weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure.  there was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 vicryl.  again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  this was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision.  a skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the iris scissors.  a dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  a hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  with this accomplished, #3-0 prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  the sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  the remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  once again hemostasis was maintained with bovie electrocautery.  finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  external ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord.  there appeared to be no evidence of compression.  finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  the patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  finally, the

initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  abdominal insufflation was performed.  there were significant adhesions noted.  a second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  after adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of toldt and mobilizing this medially.  the kidney was able to be palpated within gerota's fascia.  the psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  the uterus was grasped with a babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  the renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  there was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  we were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  an incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  a bookwalter retractor was placed.  the renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and bovie cautery.  the tissue was sent down to pathology for analysis.  please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  the renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  at this point, the indwelling double-j ureteral stent was removed.  at this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 vicryl suture was placed.  this was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  the back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was
