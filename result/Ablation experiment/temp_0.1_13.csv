11. Description of operation: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors. The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered. The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity. There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord. The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created. The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation. No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used. The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis. A similar procedure was performed on the right side. Again, an appendix testis was cauterized. No torsion was seen. He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture. The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% marcaine. The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic. Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used.","Based on the text provided, the patient is a 4-year-old boy."
"Dr. Y and Dr. X performed a laparoscopic nephrolithotomy on a 65-year-old male patient with a history of bilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. The procedure involved the following steps:

1. Preparation: The patient was given general anesthesia and was positioned in the flank position with adequate padding on the arms and legs. Dr. Y then sterilely prepped and drape the patient's lower abdomen.
2. Incision: Dr. X made a 15-blade incision through the old scar tissue and extended it to create a new incision.
3. Dissection: Dr. Y and Dr. X dissect the lumbosacral fascia, dividing the latissimus dorsi fascia and posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using electrocautery. They then used curved mosquito clamps to dissect around the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.
4. Tissue removal: The tissue was inflamed and had significant adhesions, with the patient's spermatic vessels and renal vessels also present in the region. Dr. Y and Dr. X carefully dissect the renal pelvis to isolate the ureteropelvic junction area, where they placed stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic suture to repair the obstructed area.
5. Stent placement: Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm and gently delivered a stent in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal end, leaving it alone in the bladder. Dr. X then incised the renal pelvis and dissects it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.
6. Suture placement: Dr. Y placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, while Dr. X placed interrupted sutures on the medial aspect. The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation, and alternating sutures were closed by Dr. Y and Dr. X without any evidence of leakage.
7. Biopsy: Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and incised a wedge biopsy, excising the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy determination of renal tissue health. Electrocautery was used on the base.
8. Closure: Dr. Y closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 vicryl in 3 layers, while Dr. X closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 rapide, respectively. A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.
9. Post-operative care: A dry sterile dressing was placed over the incision, and a foley catheter was placed in the bladder. The patient was transferred to the recovery room for observation.

Overall, the laparoscopic nephrolithotomy was successful in removing the obstructed ureteropelvic junction and repairing the renal pelvis, allowing for proper urine flow and preventing further complications.","Dr. Y and Dr. X performed a laparoscopic nephrolithotomy on a 65-year-old male patient with a history of bilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and the patient was positioned in the flank position with adequate padding on the arms and legs. Dr. Y incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision, and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamps. Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised, and then they divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps. Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissecting around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum. Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length. The tissue was markedly inflamed, and there were significant adhesions noted. The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.

To repair the ureteropelvic junction obstruction, Dr. Y placed stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic suture to isolate the four quadrant area where the ureter was replaced. Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture. Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder. Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissecting enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed. Dr. Y placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair, and then alternating sutures by Dr. X and Dr. Y closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage. Once this was complete, the extra stay stitches were removed, and the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good condition. A biopsy was then performed to determine the renal tissue health, and the site was closed with thrombin-gelfoam and dermabond. Finally, Dr. Y closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 vicryl in three layers, and Dr. X closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 rapide, respectively. A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision, and a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped. A foley catheter was then placed in the bladder, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

"The patient underwent a radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection. The operation was performed by Dr. A, who gave the patient prophylactic antibiotics in the preoperative holding area before transferring him to the operating room. The patient received general endotracheal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia without any complications.

The procedure began with a midline infraumbilical incision, and the rectus fascia and subcutaneous space were opened using a #10 scalpel blade. The transversalis fascia was then opened in the midline, and the retropubic space and paravesical space were developed bluntly. A bookwalter retractor was placed to expose the area of the obturator lymph nodes, which were carefully inspected but found to be free of any suspicious adenopathy.

Given the patient's low Gleason score and low PSA, along with a solitary core biopsy positive result, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors, and the area was carefully inspected for any signs of lymph node involvement.

The prostate was then retracted cephalad using fine forceps, and the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using a Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the vein was controlled using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then disected out using a bladder neck dissection method, and the seminal vesicles were identified and transected using a bipolar gyrus coagulation device.

The prostate was sent for permanent sectioning, and the opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 vicryl sutures. A 15 ml of sterile water was inflated to balloon, and the bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-french Blake drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region to collect any bleeding or fluid.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the wounds were closed in running fashion using #1 pds for the rectus fascia, 2-0 vicryl sutures for the subcutaneous space, and metallic clips for the skin. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",The patient is 67 years old.

"The patient treatment plan described in the text is for prostate brachytherapy using i-125 seeds. The treatment involves ultrasound-guided implantation of the seeds into the prostate gland. The original consultation and treatment planning will be performed separately, and special coordination will be required at the time of implantation. The positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process may result in discrepancies, and re-assessment is required to modify the plan as needed. The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate, with attention given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder.","Based on the text provided, the patient's age is not explicitly mentioned. However, the text does mention that the patient will undergo ""prostate brachytherapy - prostate i-125 implantation,"" which typically involves patients who are middle-aged or older, as prostate cancer is more common in men over the age of 50. Therefore, based on the context of the text, it can be inferred that the patient's age is likely in the range of 50 to 80 years old, but this is only an estimate and cannot be confirmed without additional information."
"The patient treatment plan described in the text is as follows:

1. Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty: The patient underwent a robotic-assisted pyeloplasty procedure to treat right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. This involved mobilizing the colon and entering the retroperitoneum, dissecting the renal pelvis and proximal ureter, and extracting four round kidney stones.
2. Anterograde right ureteral stent placement: A 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde through the ureter to treat the obstruction.
3. Transposition of anterior crossing vessels on the right: The crossing renal artery was transposed using vicryl sutures to impinge less upon the renal pelvis.
4. Nephrolithotomy: The patient underwent nephrolithotomy to remove kidney stones from the renal pelvis.

The diagnosis was right ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and the procedure was performed under general anesthesia with intravenous preoperative antibiotics. The patient was positioned in the right flank position with a right arm hanger and padded pressure points were taken to minimize discomfort during the procedure. Sequential compression devices were also placed to prevent venous thromboembolism.

The procedure involved mobilizing the colon and entering the retroperitoneum, where the renal pelvis and proximal ureter were dissectected using electrocautery and blunt dissection. Four round kidney stones were extracted from the renal pelvis and sent for analysis. The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors, and redundant renal pelvis was excised and sent for permanent section. A heel stitch was then placed at the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis for ureter-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi-running fashion. Finally, the pyelotomy was completely closed with 2-0 monocryl sutures, and a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde through the ureter.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and no immediate perioperative complications were noted. The patient was discharged to the post-anesthesia care unit and subsequently to the genitourinary floor to begin their recovery.",The patient is 30 years old.
"The patient treatment plan described in the text is as follows:

1. Cystourethroscopy: A #21 French cystoscope was passed through the urethra into the bladder for visualization and examination of the urinary tract.
2. Right retrograde pyelogram: A contrast medium was injected through a catheter inserted through the right ureteral orifice to visualize the right kidney and ureter. An upj calculus was noted without any signs of hydronephrosis.
3. Right double-J stent placement: A 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was passed over a guidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the distal right ureter to treat the upj calculus. The stent was placed within the kidney as well as within the bladder.
4. Procedure: The patient was given general anesthesia and then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The cystoscope was passed through the urethra into the bladder, but there was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage. No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings were seen in the bladder. Attempts to pass a cone tip catheter through the ureteral orifice were unsuccessful due to tightness, but a glidewire was passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis. An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed into the distal right ureter.
5. Post-procedure: The patient tolerated the procedure well and will be discharged home with prescription for darvocet. She is to follow up with Dr. X for ESWL procedure and to have a KUB x-ray done prior to her appointment.","The patient's age is not explicitly stated in the text, but based on the language used and the medical procedures described, it can be inferred that the patient is an adult. The use of terms like ""general anesthesia"" and ""ureteral orifice"" suggest that the patient is at least 18 years old, if not older. Additionally, the mention of a ""follow-up appointment with Dr. X"" implies that the patient has already undergone some medical treatment, which is typically done after a patient reaches adulthood. Therefore, based on the context of the text, it can be estimated that the patient's age is likely in the range of 18 to 65 years old."
"The patient underwent an open radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection. The procedure was performed to treat prostate cancer, specifically a Gleason score 4+3 with an 85% burden and positive results in 8/12 cores.

The patient was brought to the operating room and given general anesthesia. The abdomen and pelvis were prepped and draped sterilely, and a Foley catheter was inserted. An incision was made from the symphysis pubis to the umbilicus, and the bed was flexed to expose the lower abdominal area. The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped and scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.

The dissection began by splitting the Scarpa's fascia and incising the rectus sheath. The muscle was split in the middle, and the space of the rectus sheath was entered. The prostate gland was then identified, and bilateral lymph node dissection was performed.

During the procedure, significant oozing and bleeding were noted from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue. The bleeding was controlled using clips, vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, as well as direct pressure packing and Floseal application to the pelvis.

The prostate gland was then excised, and the bladder neck was repaired using vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion. The wound was copiously irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 monocryl in subcuticular fashion. The procedure was terminated with no complications, and the patient was extubated and taken to the PACU in stable condition.",The patient is 66 years old.
"The patient has been treated for recurrent Gleason 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate with radiation therapy, and is now experiencing a slow rise in PSA levels. The patient's urinary function has been stable until recently, when he started waking up every 1-1/2 hours with abdominal cramping and a sore throat. His libido remains intact, but his erections have become dysfunctional. The patient's bowel function is stable with occasional irritative hemorrhoidal symptoms, and he has not experienced any hematochezia. The patient's pain assessment is a score of 1-2 out of 10, and his performance status is Karnofsky score of 100, indicating that he is able to work full-time. The patient's nutritional status has been affected by depressed appetite and weight loss of 5 pounds over the past week. The patient is experiencing some stress regarding upcoming IRS audits of clients. The patient's review of systems is noncontributory, and he is taking Nyquil, timolol eye drops, aspirin, advil, and zinc supplements.

The physical examination reveals a pleasant, well-developed gentleman with no acute distress. The patient's weight is 197 pounds, and his HEN&T (head, eyes, nose, throat) examination is unremarkable. There is minor pharyngitis, but no palpable lymphadenopathy or focal skeletal tenderness. The patient's chest examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally, and his cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm. The abdomen is soft and nontender without palpable mass or organomegaly, and the digital rectal examination reveals external hemorrhoids with no suspicious nodularity in the prostate fossa. There is no blood on the examining glove, and the patient's extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. The neurological examination is unremarkable, with no focal deficit.

Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the doctor has concluded that the rise in PSA levels is concerning and may indicate residual cancer in the prostate area, although the location is unknown. The doctor has advised the patient to return for follow-up evaluation in 3 months with an updated PSA level, and has suggested that he reestablish contact with Dr. X at his convenience.","The patient is 54 years old (based on the text: ""the patient returns for followup evaluation 21 months after undergoing prostate fossa irradiation for recurrent gleason 8 adenocarcinoma"")."
"Based on the information provided in the text, the patient treatment plan described is as follows:

1. Prostate biopsy: The patient underwent a sextant biopsy of the prostate, which revealed a small focus of adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of the prostate (Gleason score 3 + 3).
2. Radical prostatectomy: The patient underwent a radical prostatectomy, which involved excision of the prostate gland, including the capsule, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and a small portion of the bladder neck. The pathology report revealed that the prostate gland showed moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 3 + 2), with tumor involvement extending to the apex of both lobes of the prostate.
3. Surgical margin: The surgical margin was involved at the apex of the prostate gland.
4. Post-op recovery: The patient has made good post-op recovery, with mild urgency incontinence being the only complication noted. His post-op PSA level is 0.1 mg/ml.

Based on these findings, the patient's treatment plan may involve further testing and monitoring to determine the best course of action for his prostate cancer. This may include additional imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRI, to assess the extent of the tumor and identify any potential metastases. The patient may also undergo hormone therapy to reduce the levels of male hormones, which can slow the growth of the tumor. In some cases, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be considered as part of the treatment plan.",The patient is 46 years old.
"Based on the information provided in the text, the patient treatment plan is as follows:

2. Pathology report: The pathology report revealed that the prostate biopsy samples were positive for adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with a Gleason score of 7/10. The maximum linear extent of the tumor in the apex was 6 mm.
3. Treatment plan: The patient opted for low dose rate interstitial prostatic implants of i-125, which were performed as an outpatient on August 10th.

Overall, the treatment plan involves using radiation therapy to treat the cancerous cells in the prostate gland. The specific dosage and delivery method (low dose rate interstitial implants) were chosen based on the patient's overall health and medical history, as well as the extent and location of the cancer.",The patient is 63 years old.
"Based on the information provided in the text, the patient treatment plan is as follows:

1. Referral to Urology: The patient will be referred to a urologist for excision and biopsy of the penile mass.
2. Excision and Biopsy: The urologist will perform an excision and biopsy of the mass to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Follow-up: The patient will need to follow up with the urologist for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's history of a large, non-bleeding bump on the end of his penis for over a year and a half, without any pain or itching, suggests that it may be a benign lesion such as a condyloma acuminata, which is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). The fact that the bump bent backwards and ripped a portion of the skin on the tip of his penis last night, causing bleeding, supports this diagnosis.

The patient's sexual history, including being monogamous with the same person for 13 years, suggests that he may have contracted the infection through sexual contact. The absence of any other symptoms such as fever, chills, or night sweats also supports this diagnosis.

"The patient underwent a penile prosthesis implantation procedure. The surgery was performed by Dr. McDevitt, assisted by Dr. Stomel. Here is a summary of the steps taken during the operation:

1. The patient was given general anesthesia and positioned on the operating table in the supine position.
2. A sterile draping was placed around the penis area, and the surgical site was cleaned and prepared for the procedure.
3. Half of the pump and all the tubing were removed, and both corporal bodies were dilated with Pratt dilators. The corporal bodies were then measured, and a 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis was used.
4. Rear tips were placed using the Farlow device, and the size of the rear tips was reduced from 2 cm to 1 cm due to difficulty in placing them.
5. The right corporal body was then dilated and prepared for the implantation of the prosthesis.
6. The prosthesis was inserted through the glans penis using the Keith needle, and the rear tips were placed proximally and distally without any complications.
7. Attention was then taken to the left side of the corpora, and the same procedure was carried out without any difficulties.
8. The wound was copiously irrigated, and the device was inflated multiple times to ensure a good fit.
9. The pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, and the connection between the reservoir and the pump was made without any complications.
10. The entire system, including the prosthesis and the corporal bodies, was flushed and air bubbles were evacuated.
11. After completion of the connection, the prosthesis was inflated, and good erection was achieved in both cylinders with a slight deviation to the left, which could be corrected with good cosmetic results.
12. The soft tissue was reapproximated to prevent the cylinders from lying against each other, and the wound was closed in multiple layers.
13. Sterile dressing was applied, and the patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

The patient will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt for further observation and care, and cardiology will be consulted for a pacer placement.","The patient underwent a penile prosthesis implantation procedure. The surgery involved several steps:

1. Removal of the old prosthesis: The surgeon removed the existing inflatable penile prosthesis.
2. Exploration of the corporal bodies: The surgeon dilated the corporal bodies with Pratt dilators and irrigated them with antibiotic solution.
3. Measurement of the corporal bodies: The surgeon measured the length of the corporal bodies using the Farlow device, finding them to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.
4. Placement of the new prosthesis: The surgeon placed a new inflatable penile prosthesis using the Farlow device and Keith needle. The prosthesis was inflated multiple times, and the surgeon noted a good fit and result.
5. Closure of the wound: The surgeon closed the wound with #2-0 pds in a running fashion, irrigating the area copiously and flushing the system.
6. Placement of the reservoir device: The surgeon made an incision in the external oblique aponeurosis and developed a dissection down underneath the rectus space for the reservoir device. The device was subsequently placed without difficulty, and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 vicryl were used to close the defect in the rectus.
7. Connection of the pump and reservoir: The surgeon connected the pump to the reservoir using a straight connector, and the entire system was flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.
8. Final closure: The surgeon closed the wound in multiple layers, applying sterile dressing and wrapping the penis with Coban. The patient was then straight catheterized, and approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine was expressed. No Foley catheter was used or placed.

The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Cardiology was consulted for a pacer placement, and the patient was placed on the telemetry floor and kept on iv antibiotics."

No tubes or drains were used during the procedure. Sponge and needle counts were correct twice. No tissues were sent to pathology. The anesthesia used was general inhalational anesthetic.

The operation involved a superior curvilinear scrotal incision, followed by dissection into the scrotal space using a curved cryoclamp. The testis was not visualized in the external ring, so the sac was brought up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised with a 15-blade knife. The gubernacular structures were then dissected off the testis, and the sac was opened and dissected off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation, and local anesthetic and ilioinguinal nerve block were administered. The external oblique fascia was closed with a running suture of 0-vicryl, ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure. The scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 rapide subcuticular closure.

The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation, and the upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision. IV toradol was given to the patient at the end of the procedure, and both testes were well descended in the scrotum.","Based on the text provided, the patient is approximately 4 years old."
"The patient treatment plan described in the text is for a 8-year-old boy who has been found to have a left undescended testis. The diagnosis is confirmed through ultrasound, which shows metastasis in the left inguinal canal. The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal and appears normal. The patient undergoes bilateral orchiopexy, a surgical procedure to correct undescended testes.

The operative findings reveal that both testes appear viable and normal in size for the boy's age. However, there is a hernia on the left side, and the spermatic cord requires a Prentiss maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement.

The operative procedure involves taking the patient to the operating room, where he is placed under general anesthesia administered by Dr. X. The lower abdomen and genitalia are prepared with betadine and draped aseptically. A 0.25% marcaine is infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease of the left groin, and an inguinal incision is made through this area. The external ring is exposed with dissection, and the fascia is opened in the direction of its fibers, exposing the testes. The testes are freed by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia, and the hernia sac is separated from the cord, twisted, and suture-ligated at the internal ring. Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords are divided high into the inguinal internal ring, allowing for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension.

On the opposite side, an orchiopexy is performed in a similar fashion, but there is no inguinal hernia, and the testes are located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal. The sub dartos pouch is created in a similar fashion, and the wounds are closed similarly as well.

The estimated blood loss is less than 20 to 30 ml, and there are no apparent complications. Instrument and sponge counts are correct, and the patient is transported to the post-anesthetic recovery area in satisfactory condition.","Based on the text provided, the patient is 8 years old."

9. Description of operation: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once anesthetized, a caudal block was placed, and the patient was placed in a supine position and examined. The left testis was found to be well within the scrotum, but the right testis was not palpable despite multiple attempts. The patient was then prepped and draped, and an 8-french feeding tube was placed through the urethra and attached to the drainage. An incision was made in the infraumbilical area with a 15 blade knife, and the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide. The short 0-degree lens was used for laparoscopy, and the closed ring with vessels going to the left and absent vas on the right was visualized. Since no testis was found in the abdomen, the gas was evacuated, and the fascial sheath was closed with 3-0 monocryl tacking sutures. The skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 rapide, and a curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with a 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped, and the testis was removed, tied off with a 4-0 vicryl suture, and placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. The dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure were closed with 4-0 chromic on the left hemiscrotum. At the end of the procedure, the patient received iv toradol, and dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.","Based on the text provided, the patient is 2 years old."

3. Hernia sac identification: A hernia sac was identified, and the testicle was located.
4. Dissection of hernia sac: The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture, and it was noted that it retracted into the abdominal cavity.
5. Division of abnormal attachments: The abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas, and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.
6. Reduction of testicle: The testicle was wrapped in a moist sponge, and then a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal into the scrotum. A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall, and dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.
7. Closure: The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision. The neck was then closed with a 4-0 vicryl suture that was not too tight but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle. The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch, and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic suture.
8. Reapproximation: The transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly. This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.
9. Closure of external oblique: The external oblique muscle was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.
10. Closure of Scarpa's layer: The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a running 4-0 vicryl intracuticular stitch. Benzoin and a steri-strip were applied.

5. Over 2 liters of antibiotic irrigation solution were used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.
6. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum to drain any remaining pus.
7. The right testicle was found to be abnormal but not necrotic, and a decision was made to place 4-0 prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent torsion.
8. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 vicryl in interrupted stitches, and the skin was closed using 2-0 pds in horizontal mattress.
9. Minimal pus was left behind, and the skin was found to be healthy.

The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.",The patient is 49 years old.
"The patient treatment plan described in the text is a left orchiopexy procedure. The patient, a 16-year-old African American male, had an ectopic left testis that was located near the pubic tubercle. The patient underwent a general anesthetic and received antibiotics prior to the procedure. The surgeon made an oblique skin incision over the spermatic cord region, dissecting the fascia down both bluntly and sharply and maintaining hemostasis with bovie electrocautery. The external ring was then encountered and grasped with hemostats, and the testis was identified and exposed. The surgeon then created a tunnel through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment and made a transverse incision in the scrotal skin. The apices of the dartos were then entered with bovie electrocautery, and a supra-dartos pouch was created using iris scissors. The testis was then pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch, ensuring that the anatomical position was maintained, and sutures were used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis. The surgeon then approximated the skin with sutures and applied subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic. Finally, the patient was cleansed, and a scrotal support was placed. The patient was instructed to take keflex for 7 days, tylenol #3 for severe pain, and motrin for moderate pain, and to apply ice packs to the scrotum. The patient will follow up with Dr. X in 10-14 days for further evaluation.","Based on the text provided, the patient is 16 years old."
"The patient treatment plan described in the text is for a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes. The plan is for exploration and possible orchiopexy (surgical repair of the undescended testes). The procedure involves examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.

The preoperative diagnosis is bilateral undescended testes, and the postoperative diagnosis is bilateral undescended testes and bilateral intraabdominal testes (testes that are located inside the abdomen).

During the procedure, the surgeon used laparoscopic instruments to evaluate the testes and determine the best course of action. The left testis was found to have short vessels and was barely visualized, while the right testis was larger and had better vessels. The surgeon elected to perform an orchiopexy on the right testis.

The procedure involved making an incision in the abdomen and dissecting the tissue around the testis to bring it down into the scrotum. The surgeon used laparoscopic instruments to make a subdartos pouch and pull the testis through it in the proper orientation. The surgeon then closed the incision with sutures.

The patient received iv toradol for pain management during and after the procedure, and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",The patient is 7 months old.
"Based on the operative note provided, the patient underwent a meatoplasty procedure, which involves surgical modification of the foreskin and glans of the penis. The treatment plan described is as follows:

"Based on the text provided, the patient underwent a laparoscopic pyeloplasty procedure to treat right ureteropelvic junction obstruction, severe intraabdominal adhesions, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The procedure involved the following steps:

1. Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions: The surgeon performed adhesiolysis (removal of adhesions) for approximately two-and-a-half hours through multiple ports placed in the abdomen.
2. Attempted laparoscopic pyeloplasty: After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially. The kidney was palpated within Gerota's fascia, and the psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified.
3. Open pyeloplasty: Due to significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes, the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open. An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline, and a bookwalter retractor was placed. The renal pelvis and ureter were identified, and fibrotic tissue was dissected away using right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.
4. Closure: The abdominal incision was closed with running #0 vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia. The scarpa's fascia was closed with interrupted #3-0 vicryl suture, and the skin edges were closed with staples.

"The patient treatment plan described in the text is for a laparoscopic right inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh repair, as well as a circumcision. The patient is a 66-year-old African American male who presented to Dr. Y's office with recurrent right inguinal hernia for the second time, requesting hernia repair. The procedure was discussed with the patient, and he opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at open inguinal repair on the right side. Additionally, the patient requested circumcision at the same operating time.

The intraoperative findings revealed a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced. The patient was found to have phimosis, which was also easily removed. The procedure involved making an infraumbilical incision with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel, elevating the umbilical skin with a towel clip, and inserting a Veress needle without difficulty. The abdomen was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg, and a #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty. The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted, and the abdomen was explored.

The next steps involved placing #12 ports in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus, and again in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization. A grasper with a blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac, and an endoshears was used to score the peritoneum towards the midline and laterally. The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, identifying the iliopubic tract without difficulty. Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum, and a piece of Prolene mesh was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract. The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum, and the patient was re-peritonealized.

After completing the hernia repair, attention was turned to carrying out the circumcision. The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head, and the desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker. The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head, and a #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as a specimen. The remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with bovie electrocautery, and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially. A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing, and the patient tolerated the procedure well, being transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition.",The patient is 66 years old.
