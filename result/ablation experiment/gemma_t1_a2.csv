**Estimated Blood Loss:**
- Minimal

**Fluids:**
- Crystalloid

**History:**
- History of turp

**Reason for Treatment:**
- Poor stream due to mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder

- Laser vaporization may improve stream

**Risks of Treatment:**
- Increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications

**Informed Consent:**
- Patient understood the benefits and risks of laser vaporization and consented to the procedure

**Additional Notes:**
- The patient was given anticholinergics to help manage urinary symptoms.
- The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder.","The patient is 67 years old based on the text. The passage does not specify a specific age in the text, but it states that the patient is 67 years old."

**Patient treatment plan:**

* Direct inguinal hernia repair using the Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy technique.
* Preoperative diagnosis: inguinal hernia.
* Postoperative diagnosis: direct inguinal hernia.
* Procedure performed: Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy.
* Anesthesia: general endotracheal.
* Description of procedure:
    * The patient was brought to the operating suite and placed supine on the operating table.
    * General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.
    * A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of metzenbaum scissors and bovie electrocautery.
    * The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.
    * The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using metzenbaum scissors.
    * The cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.
    * This penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.
* Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using bovie electrocautery, and the cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found.
* The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels.
* This was dissected back to the hernia opening.
* The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large perfix plug inserted into the ring.
* The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 prolene sutures.
* The perfix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 prolene sutures.
* By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed.
* The penrose drain was removed.
* The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using bovie electrocautery.
* The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.
* The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.
* The skin was prepped with benzoin, and steri-strips were applied.","The patient's age is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I cannot determine their age."
