**Description of Operation:**
- The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.
- A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.
- We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.
- We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.
- We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.
- The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.
- We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight joseph scissors.
- Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 vicryl suture.
- We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.
- We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.
- We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.
- The patient was found to have a type iii epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.
- The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.
- The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.
