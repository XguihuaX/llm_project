**Patient:** A 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes

**Procedure:**

1. Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.
2. Preoperative diagnosis: Bilateral undescended testes.
3. Postoperative diagnosis: Bilateral intraabdominal testes.
4. Examination under anesthesia and laparoscopic right orchiopexy.
5. Estimated blood loss: less than 5 ml.
6. Fluids received: 110 ml of crystalloid.
7. Intraoperative findings: Atrophic bilateral testes, right is larger than left.
8. Indications for operation: Bilateral nonpalpable testes.
9. Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.
10. Description of operation:
    - The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.
    - Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.
    - Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.
    - We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-french feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.
    - We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved metzenbaum scissors.
    - Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.
    - Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmhg.
    - We then evaluated.
    - There was no bleeding noted.
11. He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.
12. The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.
13. So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.
14. Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.
15. We then used the maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.
16. The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.
17. We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.
18. We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.
19. We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.
20. Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.
21. Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.
22. Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.
23. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.
24. We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.
25. The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.
26. We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.
27. We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two monocryl stay sutures to close the skin, and closed the left subcostal margin with 4-0 silk.","The patient's age is not mentioned in the context, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context."

* Description of procedure: The patient underwent a standard inguinal incision and dissection to repair an inguinal hernia.
* Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.
* The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
* A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of metzenbaum scissors and bovie electrocautery.
* The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.
* The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using metzenbaum scissors.
* The cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.
* The penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.
* Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using bovie electrocautery.
* The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found.
* The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels.
* This was dissected back to the hernia opening.
* The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large perfix plug inserted into the ring.
* The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 prolene sutures.
* The perfix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 prolene sutures.
* By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed.
* The penrose drain was removed.
* The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using bovie electrocautery.
* The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.
* The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.
* The skin was prepped with benzoin, and steri-strips were applied.","The text does not provide the patient's age, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context."
"Sure, here's a summary of the patient treatment plan described in the text:

**Patient assessment and preparation:**

- Informed consent was obtained.
- The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.
- A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis.

**Surgery:**

- The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue.
- The external ring was delineated.
- The external oblique was incised with a scalpel.
- The cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection.
- A penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.
- The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.

**Closure:**

- The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and bovie electrocautery.
- Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature.
- The sac was excised and went to pathology.
- The ends of the suture were then cut and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.
- The penrose drain was removed.
- The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using bovie electrocautery.
- The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 3-0 vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.
- The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.
- The skin was prepped and draped with benzoin, and steri-strips were applied.
- A dressing consisting of a 2 x 2 and opsite was then applied.","The text does not specify the patient's age, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context."

* Procedure in detail:
    * The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.
    * General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation and the abdomen and groins were prepped and draped in standard, sterile surgical fashion.
    * Ililioinguinal nerve block on both sides was performed, injecting marcaine 1 fingerbreadth anterior and 1 fingerbreadth superior to the anterior superior iliac spine on both sides.","The context does not specify the patient's age, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context."
"Sure, here is the patient treatment plan described in the text:

**Patient Name:** Not provided in the context.

**Procedure:** Marlex repair of right inguinal hernia.

**Steps:**

1. Patient is taken to the operative suite in the supine position.
2. Right inguinal region is shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.
3. 1 gm of ancef iv push is administered.
4. A transverse incision is made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue.
5. The external oblique fascia is exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring.
6. The spermatic cord and hernia sac are dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal.
7. The floor of the inguinal canal is imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 prolene.
8. A marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension is trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord.
9. It is placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 prolene.
10. The patch is then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 prolene.
11. The area is irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% marcaine with epinephrine is injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief.
12. The cord is returned to its position.
13. External oblique fascia is closed with a running 2-0 pds, subcu with 2-0 vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 vicryl and steri-strips.","The text does not provide information about the patient's age, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context."
